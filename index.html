      <p> Belinda Mager, director of communications for DSNY, said in an email, “In the face of economic hardship, and to ensure the City can continue to devote resources to essential safety, health, and shelter, and food security needs, our curbside
        composting program was suspended, beginning May 4, 2020. The suspension is currently planned through June 30, 2021.” </p>

          <P> In Williamsburg, the total amount of residential waste collected by DSNY has been increasing in 2020. People are now spending more time at home, rather than commuting to an office or going to school. With an increase in total waste,
            comes an increase in organics. </P>
        </div>

      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p> Ceci Pineda, the executive director of BK Rot, would like to see compost prioritized. “I feel like the city is just not recognizing the bigger picture or even the root causes of the moment we are in with this pandemic. I see this pandemic
          arising from a lot of unsustainable global practices.” Many Williamsburg residents have had to turn to BK Rot, which is in Bushwick, to drop their scraps. </p>
